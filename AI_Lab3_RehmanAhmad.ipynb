    "# Task 6 — Mini Data Analyzer\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "In this task, we will **analyze a list of numbers** and calculate:  \n",
    "- Maximum value  \n",
    "- Minimum value  \n",
    "- Average value  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will also print which numbers are **above the average**.  \n",
    "This demonstrates how AI (and data science) can **extract insights from raw data**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps\n",
    "1. Define a list of numbers (e.g., `[10, 23, 45, 67, 89, 12, 34, 56]`).  \n",
    "2. Create a function `analyze_data(nums)` that will:  \n",
    "   - Use `max(nums)` → find maximum.  \n",
    "   - Use `min(nums)` → find minimum.  \n",
    "   - Use `sum(nums)/len(nums)` → calculate average.  \n",
    "3. Print the original list and calculated values.  \n",
    "4. Find all numbers above the average using a loop or list comprehension.  \n",
    "5. Print the numbers above the average.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practice Variation\n",
    "- Instead of **hardcoding the list**, take input from the user:  \n",
    "  - Ask the user to enter numbers separated by spaces.  \n",
    "  - Use `split()` to divide input into parts.  \n",
    "  - Convert them into integers using `map(int, ...)`.  \n",
    "  - Example:  \n",
    "    - Input: `10 20 30 40`  \n",
    "    - Output:  \n",
    "      - Maximum: 40  \n",
    "      - Minimum: 10  \n",
    "      - Average: 25  \n",
    "      - Numbers above average: [30, 40]  \n",

    "- Example:  \n",
    "  - `map(int, [\"10\", \"20\", \"30\"])` → converts all string numbers to integers.  \n",
